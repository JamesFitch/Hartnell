<h3>Setting up Menu Mini panels</h3>
<p>We are assuming that the module is downloaded and enabled, along with its dependencies.</p>
<ol class="numeric">
<li>First, select <strong>Structure</strong> from the admin menu, then <strong>Mini Panels</strong></li>

<li>The next page, <strong>Context</strong>, is beyond the scope of this documentation. Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>
<li>The next page, <strong>Layout</strong>, you will want to explore a little. In the pulldown called <strong>Category</strong>, there are a number of different layouts. We recommend keeping it simple until you're used to filling minipanels -- choose a layout of one, two or three columns. And then click <strong>Continue</strong>.<br>
<img class="pic" src="&path&screenshots/minipanel_2.PNG" alt="your choice of layouts"></li>
<li>This last page, <strong>Content</strong>, is the most important one of all. You will want to click on the tiny, almost not visible cog in the top lefthand side of the Center box. For your enjoyment, I've blown up the little guy to 3 times its normal size.<br>
<img class="pic" src="&path&screenshots/minipanel_cog.png" alt="the cog in all of its vagueness"><br>
When you click on the cog, you will see a tiny menu -- and you will want to click on <strong>Add Content</strong><br>
