<h3>Sending a CWI Newsletter</h3>

<p>When you are ready to send your newsletter, go to the Newsletter tab of the CWI Newsletter content you want to e-mail.</p>

<h3>Sending a test e-mail</h3>
<p>It is good practice to send out a test newsletter to your own email address before sending it out to your entire list. To do this, within the Newsletter tab, under the Sending Newsletter heading, select "Send one test newsletter to the test address and verify or enter the appropriate e-mail address. Click Submit. Depending on the mail server and cron setup, you may have to manually run cron for the mail server to actually send the test. (In Admin Menu, over over the Home Icon and select "Run cron.")</p>

<h3>Sending to your mailing list</h3>
<p>When you are ready to send the newsletter to your mailing list, you may return to the Newsletter tab of the content you want to send and select the "Send newsletter" option, then Submit. The next time cron is run, the newsletter will be e-mailed.</p>
