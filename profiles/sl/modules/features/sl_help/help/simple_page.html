<h3>The basics of creating a page</h3>
<p>Pages in the site can be simple or complex, and layouts can vary widely.  The simplest page you can create consists of a title, plus some content.</p>
<p>When creating a page, visit 'Content | Add content | Flexible Page' on the menu at the top of the screen - you'll be presented with a form like this: </p>

<img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/page-stdfields.png" />
<p>Fill out the <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Body</strong> fields.  Then, you'll want to click on the vertical tab to the left, labeled 'About this content'.  Here's a description for each of the 'About this content' fields:

<dl>
  <dt>Editorial Department</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is a list of the editorial groups you belong to.  The value you pick here will determine who can edit your content besides you.</p>
    <p>You probably belong to just one editorial group, but it's possible that you belong to several.  Everyone in your editorial group will have permission to edit this content with you, so if you're in more than one group, you'll want to be sure the right group is selected for the page you're authoring.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Audience<dt>
  <dd>This field allows you to select whom your page is written for.  Pick all the audiences that apply. Your page will show on the appropriate gallery page for the selected audiences </dd>
  
  <dt>Topic<dt>
  <dd>This field lets you categorize your page with topics from across the CWI site.  Similar to the audience values, your page will be shown on gallery pages corresponding to the topics you select.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Be sure and click 'save' when you're done editing your page.</p>
