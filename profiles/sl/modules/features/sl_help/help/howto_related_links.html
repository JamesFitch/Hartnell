<h2>How to add related links to the sidebar</h2>

<p>The left sidebar always contains a menu.  That menu is determined by where your page fits in the site map.</p>

<p>However, you can make custom links for the left sidebar, which function like menus but are just for your page.  </p>
<p>You can create these links to other related site pages by using the Related items vertical tab. There are fields for Related Links, Contact Person, and Location.</p>

<p>To add a Related Link, just type in the title, and the URL.</p>

<p>For Contact Person, and Location, start typing in the field, and the titles of pages matching your search will appear.  Click on the page you want to select it. If you need to create a Person or Location, you can click on the + Create button associated with that field.</p>
<p>If you'd like to add another (link, person, location), just click on the Add another item button below that form.</p>
<p>Click save when you're done adding links, contact people and locations.</p>

<p>You'll see your links in the sidebar -- but not the contact person or the location. Let's add them now. </p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Panelizer | Content screen for your page, choose the  region where you want the Contact Person and/or Location to show, and click the gear and then 'add content'.</li>
  <li>Choose 'Node' from the left side tabs, and click 'Field: Contact person: (field_reference_person)' or 'Field: Location (field_flexpage_location)'

 </li>
 <li>Click through til 'Finish'</li>
  <li>Click 'Save' at the bottom-left of the screen.</li>
  <li>Click the page Title in the Breadcrumbs to see how it all turned out.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Adding and removing related links</h4>
<p>Fill out the 'Title' and 'URL' fields.  
<p>Click 'add another' below your list of links as many times as needed to create your group of links.
<p>To delete a link from the group, just clear the url and title fields.   
<p>The 'Remove' button refers to the entire group of links - you can blow them all away at once if you click it.  Be careful!
<h4>Internal and external links</h4>
<p>Links from outside the site can be pasted here, as well as links inside the Gateway site.  
<p>If you link to a page on the website, you only need to add the part of the url after the domain name, with no leading slash.  Example: &path&/path/to/your/page should be pasted in as path/to/your/page.
<p>External links can be pasted in as-is, and they should work fine.

<h4>Adding another group of links</h4>
<p>Besides adding links to the same group, you can add an entirely new group of links.  The 'Add another' button (the second one, not the first, see screen shot) will start a new group of links.

<h4>Sorting links</h4>
<p>You can sort your links (and your link groups) by using the drag handles on the left of the link groups to pull your desired links up and down.  That's the order they'll show in the finished page.
<h4>Displaying your groups of links</h4>
<p>The first group of links will automatically show on your left sidebar in the 'full' layout.
<p>Other groups of links will need to be added to your page by hand. In order to do that, visit 'Panelizer | Content', and then:

<ol>
<li>In the left sidebar region, click the gear, then click 'Add content'</li>
<li>From the 'Node' tab on the left, choose 'Field: Related Links'
</li>

<li>Adjust your settings screen.</li>

<li>Click 'Finish'</li>
<li>Click 'Save' at the bottom left.</li>
<li>Check your page out to see if everything is where you expect it to be.
</ol>
