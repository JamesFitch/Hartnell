  <h2>How to create a Sitewide Alert</h2>

  <p>Our goal to create an alert banner, as seen below, and feature it on either single Emily Griffith page or all of the pages. Alerts can be used to post bits of information that should show across the site.</p>

 <img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/sitewide1.png" />

  <p>First we are going to navigate to gray shortcuts menu at the top of your page, and click the "Add Content".</p>
  <img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/shortcuts-add-content.jpg" />
  <p>From the 'Add Content' page select Alerts (its the first in the list).</p>

  <p>
  	The fields in the alert content type and how they work:
  <ol>
   	<li><strong>Title</strong> This is the standard field, if you look at the image below "Hartnell College Board" is the alert <strong>Title</strong>.
      <img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/sitewide2.png" /></li>
   	 	<li><strong>Body</strong> This is a more detailed announcement with all the details, imagery and video. If you click on the banner it will link you to the full alert announcement which displays this copy.</li>
      <li><strong>Alert Link</strong> This is the info that appears in the button area at the bottom of the alert page. Please limit the characters to 128 characters maximum. (including space</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p> Click the <strong>"Save"</strong> button when you are done.</p>
