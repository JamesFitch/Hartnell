<h3>Placing Individual Page Elements</h3>

<p>When editing your pages, you can fill out various fields for calls to action, video, links and text fields.  Those can be placed on your page in different combinations as needed. </p>

<p>By default, the 'full' page layout will have pre-placed most of the fields you might normally use.  Panelizer is only needed if you want to adjust that layout for your own specific needs. </p>
