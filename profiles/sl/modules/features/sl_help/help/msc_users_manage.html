<h1>Manage users</h1>
<h2>Creating a user</h2>
<p>On this site, annonymous visitors can apply for an account, but administrator approval is required before the account can become active. Only site aministrators can assing roles.</p>
<h3>To create a user:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the admin menu, go to "<b>People</b>."</li>
  <li>Click "<b>Add user</b>."<br /><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_users_adduser.jpg" alt="Add user"></li>
  <li>In "<b>Username</b>" enter the name you want to give to the user. While spaces are allowed, it can be easier and simpler to make it all one word. A good pattern is lastname+first initial. E.g. smithj</li>
  <li>In "<b>E-mail address</b>" enter the user's email address. This should be an active email account, since it can be used if the user forgets their password.</li>
  <li>In "<b>Password</b>" and "<b>Confirm password</b>" enter in a password for the user. This can be anything you like, although you should write it down or otherwise find some way to let the person whose account it is know what their password is. For security's sake they should change it once they log in for the first time.</li>
  <li>Under "<b>Roles</b>" select which additional roles, if any, this user should have.</li>
  <li>Choose whether or not to "<b>Notify user of new account</b>." This is useful in helping new users learn their login info.</li>
  <li>Click "<b>Create new account</b>" to complete the new user account creation.<br /><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_users_createaccount.jpg" alt="Create new account"></li>

</ol>
<h3>Making bulk edits/updates to users</h3>

  <li>After you have used the checkboxes to select all the users you want to edit, use the dropdown option under "<b>Update options</b>" to choose what you would like to change.<br /><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_users_updateoptions.jpg" alt="Update options"></li>
  <li>Click "<b>Update</b>" to make your changes.<br /><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_users_update.jpg" alt="Update"></li>
</ol>
<h2>How roles work</h2>
<p><b>Roles</b> are sets of permissions that can be applied to individual users. Users can belong to more than one role. Two roles, authenticated users (those users that sign up for an account) and anonymous users (those either without an account or not logged in), are supplied by default with Drupal installations. This site also has the following additional roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Content creator/editor</li>
  <li>Content reviewer/publisher</li>
  <li>Section administrator</li>
  <li>Site administrator</li>
</ul>
