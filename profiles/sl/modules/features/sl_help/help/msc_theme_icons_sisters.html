<h1>Changing the sister site images</h1>
<p>The images for the sister site logos are stored in the theme directory, specifically: <b>/sites/all/themes/omega_maricopa/images/</b> and are prefixed with "<b>logo-</b>."</p>
<h2>Changing a logo</h2>
<p>If you need to change a logo, save your new version with the exact same name as the old one, then upload it to the images directory, overwriting the old file.</p>
<p>Try to keep the dimensions approximately the same as the old version, to prevent any layout issues with the logos.</p>
<h2>Adding a new logo</h2>
<p>This is more complex than just adding a new logo image; you will also need to create a new menu item and corresponding styles. That is beyond the scope of this help documentation.</p>
