<h2>Creating complex pages with Panelizer</h2>
<p>Hartnell College's site relies on the Panels module to lay out pages.  Panels and Panelizer offer a drag-and-drop method of page layout, and have many configuration options.  </p>

<p>When you create a page, you can select from either 'simple' or 'full' layouts on the 'Panelizer' tab.  

<p>Choosing the 'full' layout will place content fields in their typical spots.  You can then review the page and make adjustments using panelizer.

<p>Simply filling out the fields for related links, slides, video and contact people and choosing the 'full' layout will place them in your page. 

<p>Pages on the Hartnell College site can be individually styled using the 'Panelizer' tab [screenshot here] 

<p>With Panelizer, you can pick the information you want and drag it to the region of the page where it belongs.  You can also adjust the look and behavior of that content by appling css classes and changing settings on some content items. 

<p>Hartnell College's pages use a layout that offers flexibility for various combinations of information on a page.  Here's a breakdown of the various regions and what they're good for:
