<h2>Glossary</h2>

<h3>#</h3>

<h4>403 error</h4>

<p>403 Forbidden error is an HTTP status code returned by a web server when a user requests a web page or media that the server does not allow them to. In other words, the server can be reached, but the server declined to allow access to the page.</p>

<h4>404 error</h4>

<p>The 404 or Not Found error message is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested.<strong>A</strong></p>

<h3>A</h3>

<h4>anonymous</h4>

<p>A visitor to a your Drupal website who is not currently logged in. Drupal considers any such visitor as being the anonymous user, with the user ID 0, and belonging to the anonymous user role.</p>

<h4>Argument</h4>

<p>A section of the path for a page on a Drupal website. In the path /node/937 the first argument is “node”, and the second is “937”. Some modules, most notably Views, allow the use of “wildcard” arguments that allow a particular page to vary depending on context.</p>

<h4>API</h4>

<p>API, an abbreviation of application program interface, is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.</p>
<p>Most operating environments, such as MS-Windows, provide an API so that programmers can write applications consistent with the operating environment. Although APIs are designed for programmers, they are ultimately good for users because they guarantee that all programs using a common API will have similar interfaces. This makes it easier for users to learn new programs.</p>

<h3>B</h3>

<h4>basic page</h4>
<p>A content type that is enabled in Drupal in the default installation profile. Typically basic pages are used for static content that can (but are not required to) be linked into the main navigation bar.</p>

<h4>block</h4>
<p>The boxes visible in the regions of a Drupal website. Most blocks (e.g., recent forum topics) are generated on-the-fly by various Drupal modules, but they can be created in the administer blocks area of a Drupal site. See the documentation for more information on blocks.</p>

<h4>book</h4>
<p>A set of pages tied together in a hierarchical sequence, perhaps with chapters, sections, subsections, and so on. You can use books for manuals, site resource guides, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), or whatever you’d like. To use books, enable the core Book module.</p>

<h4>breadcrumbs</h4>
<p>The set of links, usually near the top of the page, that shows the path you followed to locate the current page. For example, it might show Home &gt; Macadamia Nuts &gt; Current Events &gt; News Articles, meaning that you started at the home page, clicked on “Macadamia Nuts” in the menu, then selected “Current Events” in the sub-menu, and finally selected, “News Articles.” The term breadcrumbs is borrowed from Hansel and Gretel, who left crumbs of bread along their path so they could find their way back out of the forest.</p>

<h3><strong>C</strong></h3>
<h4>cache</h4>
<p>The core Drupal cache stores assembled pages and blocks for anonymous visitors in the cache tables in the database. Other popular Drupal caching options include boost, memcache, and authcache.</p>
<h4>CCK</h4>
<p>Content Construction Kit. A contributed module which permits site developers to define custom fields and content types. A variety of extension modules to CCK exist permitting specialized field definitions such as images, dates, and computed values.</p>
<h4>child</h4>
<p>Objects that can have hierarchical relationships, such as menu items, book pages, taxonomy terms and so on. A “child” menu item, for example, is nested under another menu item, which is referred to as the “parent” menu item.</p>
<h4>clean URL</h4>
<p>A URL that does not contain code. By default, Drupal uses and generates URLs for your site’s pages that look like “http://www.example.com/?q=node/83.” By enabling clean URLs this will be rewritten to “http://www.example.com/node/83”.</p>
<h4>CMS</h4>
<p>Content Management System. In the context of a Web site. a collection of tools designed to allow the creation, modification, organization and removal of information.</p>
<h4>content</h4>
<p>The text, images, and other information on a web site. Besides nodes there is more content on a typical Drupal site, such as comments and file attachments.</p>
<h4>content type</h4>
<p>Every node belongs to a single “node type” or “content type”, which defines various default settings for nodes of that type, such as whether the node is published automatically and whether comments are permitted. Common "Content Types" that just about any website would have include: blog post and page. Content types can have different fields and modules can define their own content types. The core Drupal Book and Poll modules are two examples of modules that define content types.</p>
<h4>contrib</h4>
<p>Contributed. Modules or themes that are not part of the core Drupal product. Contributed modules and themes are available for separate download from the modules and themes sections of Drupal.org downloads. These are separate from the Drupal “core”, although over time they can become part of it. Similar concepts exist in other software and are sometimes called “plugins”, “add-ons” or “extensions”.</p>
<h4>Cookie</h4>
<p>The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly prepare customized Web pages for them. When you enter a Web site using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as your name and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your Web browser which stores it for later use. The next time you go to the same Web site, your browser will send the cookie to the Web server. The server can use this information to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page you might see a welcome page with your name on it.</p>
<h4>core</h4>
<p>The files and modules included with the Drupal project download..</p>
<h4>cron</h4>
<p>A command scheduler that executes commands or scripts (e.g. scripts to backup a database) automatically at specified time and date intervals. Drupal uses a “cron job” to perform periodic tasks that help Drupal to run smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<h3>E</h3>
<h4>entity</h4>
<p>Any defined chunk of data in Drupal. This includes things like nodes, users, taxonomy terms, files, etc. Contributed modules can define custom entities. Each entity type can have multiple bundles.</p>
<h3>F</h3>
<h4>field</h4>
<p>Elements of data that can be attached to a node or other Drupal entities. Fields commonly contain text, image, or terms.</p>
<h4>filter</h4>
<p>A tool for stripping out HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and other undesirable elements from content before pages are displayed. Other filters add formatting and features such as smilies. It is possible to create custom filters that allow or forbid only those tags you wish. More information is available at the Text filters and Input Formats page.</p>
<h3>H</h3>
<h4>HEAD</h4>
<p>The current development version of Drupal.</p>
<h4>human readable</h4>
<p>Also user-friendly name. The text string used to identify a resource as displayed in the user interface, as opposed to the machine name used for internal purposes of the computer program.</p>
<h4>Hexadecimal color codes:</h4>
<p>Are colors used in designing web pages, and the methods for specifying those colors. Hexadecimal color codes begin with a hash ().There 16 million colors to choose from. These colors, when used in different combinations, can produce any color that is needed. For example, the color red, the color code is FF0000, which is '255' red, '0' green, and '0' blue. These color codes can be used to change the color of the background, text, and tables on a web page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Authors of web pages have a variety of options available for specifying colors for elements of web documents. Colors may be specified as an RGB triplet in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet); they may also be specified according to their common English names in some cases. Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to generate color values.</p>

<h3>G</h3>
<h4>GUI</h4>
<p>Pronounced GOO-ee. Acronym for graphical user interface. Abbreviated GUI (pronounced GOO-ee). A program interface that takes advantage of the computer's graphics capabilities to make the program easier to use. Well-designed graphical user interfaces can free the user from learning complex command languages. On the other hand, many users find that they work more effectively with a command-driven interface, especially if they already know the command language.</p>
<p>Graphical user interfaces, such as Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh, feature the following basic components:</p>
<ul>
<li>pointer : A symbol that appears on the display screen and that you move to select objects and commands. Usually, the pointer appears as a small angled arrow. Text -processing applications, however, use an I-beam pointer that is shaped like a capital I.</li>
<li>pointing device : A device, such as a mouse or trackball, that enables you to select objects on the display screen.</li>
<li>icons : Small pictures that represent commands, files, or windows. By moving the pointer to the icon and pressing a mouse button, you can execute a command or convert the icon into a window. You can also move the icons around the display screen as if they were real objects on your desk.</li>
<li>desktop : The area on the display screen where icons are grouped is often referred to as the desktop because the icons are intended to represent real objects on a real desktop.</li>
<li>windows: You can divide the screen into different areas. In each window, you can run a different program or display a different file. You can move windows around the display screen, and change their shape and size at will.</li>
<li>menus : Most graphical user interfaces let you execute commands by selecting a choice from a menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I</h3>
<h4>input format</h4>
<p>A tool for defining the processing that happens to user-entered text before it is shown in the browser. Usually different user roles are given permission to use different input formats depending on how much they are trusted. For those roles, the input format may often be available as an option that shows up underneath the body of a node edit form. For more information, see the Text Filters and Input Formats documentation.</p>
<h4>issue</h4>
<p>A unit of work to accomplish an improvement in a data system. An issue could be a bug, a requested feature, task, missing documentation, and so forth. The Drupal community uses the issue queue to work as a team. If you need help with a specific project, whether it is a module or theme, you should go to the issue queue.</p>
<h4>IMCE</h4>
<p>IMCE is an image/file uploader and browser that supports personal directories and quota.</p>

<h3>L</h3>
<h4>log</h4>
<p>A list of recorded events. A log may contain usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational information. Drupal’s events are logged by the modules dblog and syslog.</p>
<h3>M</h3>
<h4>machine name</h4>
<p>Also machine-readable name. The text string used by the computer to identify a resource, as opposed to the human readable name shown in the user interface. In the image below “Contact Email” would be the human readable name and field_contact_email would the machine name.</p>
<h4>menu</h4>
<p>In Drupal, the term refers both to the clickable navigational elements on a page, and to Drupal’s internal system for handling requests. When a request is sent to Drupal, the menu system uses the provided URL to determine what functions to call.</p>
<h4>module</h4>
<p>Software (usually PHP and CSS) that extends Drupal features and functionality. Drupal distinguishes between “core” and “contributed” modules.</p>
<h3>N</h3>
<h4>NID</h4>
<p>Node ID. The unique identifier for each node. It can be found in the path to the node. For example, a node with path, “http://drupal.org/node/937”, has a node ID of “937”.</p>
<h4>node</h4>
<p>A piece of content in Drupal, typically corresponding to a single page on the site, that has a title, an optional body, and perhaps additional fields. Every node also belongs to a particular content type, and can additionally be classified using the taxonomy system. Examples of nodes are polls, stories, book pages and images.</p>
<h4>node type</h4>
<p>See content type.</p>
<h3>P</h3>
<h4>page</h4>
<p>See Basic Page</p>
<h4>Panels</h4>
<p>Panels is a Drupal module which makes it easy to build multiple custom layouts.</p>

<h4>parent</h4>
<p>See child</p>
<h4>Patch</h4>
<p>A small piece of software designed to update or fix problems with a computer program or its supporting data. This includes fixing bugs, replacing graphics and improving the usability or performance. For more information, see the patch documentation.</p>
<h4>path</h4>
<p>In Drupal terms, a unique, last part of the URL for a specific function or piece of content. For instance, for a page whose full URL is http://example.com/?q=node/7, the path is “node/7”. Drupal can use clean URLs if the Path module is enabled, which would change the full URL in this example to http://example.com/node/7; the path would still be “node/7”.</p>
<h4>permission</h4>
<p>In Drupal, a tool for controlling access to content creation, modification and site administration at the application level. Library staff superusers assign permissions to roles, then assign roles to users. The first user of a Drupal site (User1) automatically receives all permissions. In operating system like UNIX, permissions are security settings restricting or allowing users to access information or perform certain functions at the operating system level. In the case of files on UNIX systems, there are three types of permissions: read, write and execute.</p>
<h4>published</h4>
<p>The state of a node that can be viewed by visitors to the website. To easily hide nodes from the public (i.e. anonymous role), make the node unpublished by unchecking “Published” in the node add/edit form.</p>
<h3>Q</h3>
<h4>queue</h4>
<p>A job management technique. Jobs waiting in a line (queue) are usually processed on a first in, first out basis or by priority, if specified. The Drupal community uses the issue queue to work as a team. If you need help with</p>
<h3>R</h3>
<h4>region</h4>
<p>Defined areas of a page where content can be placed. Basic regions include: Header, Footer, Content, Left sidebar, Right Sidebar. Different themes can define different regions so the options are often different per-site. Content is assigned to regions via blocks. They can be ordered by weight within regions to define the order in which they display.</p>
<h4>render array</h4>
<p>Render arrays are the basic building blocks of Drupal content. In Drupal 7, render arrays provide a structured way to programmatically alter content before it is displayed. Further details can be read on the Render Arrays documentation page.</p>
<h4>roles</h4>
<p>Sets of permissions that can be applied to individual users. Users can belong to more than one role. Two roles, authenticated users (those users that sign up for an account) and anonymous users (those either without an account or not logged in), are supplied by default with Drupal installations. Drupal allows creating additional.</p>
<h4>RSS</h4>
<p>Really Simple Syndication. A family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines or podcasts. An RSS document (which is called a “feed” or “web feed” or “channel”) contains either a summary of content (“teaser”) from an associated web site or the full text. RSS is one of the many ways of connecting a Drupal website with external sites, systems and data.</p>
<h4>RTBC</h4>
<p>Reviewed and tested by the community. RTBC is one of the statuses given to issues in the issue queue.</p>
<h4>RTL</h4>
<p>Right-to-left. Languages such as Arabic and Hebrew run from right to left across a written page, and need to do the same on a web browser. RTL support can be problematic in theme design, but is possible, as explained in the Drupal theme guide for RTL.</p>
<h3>S</h3>
<h4>Site map</h4>
<p>A <strong>site map</strong> (or <strong>sitemap</strong>) is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for <a title="Web design" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design">web design</a>, or a <a title="Web page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web page</a> that lists the pages on a <a title="Web site" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site">web site</a>, typically organized in hierarchical fashion. This helps visitors and <a title="Search engine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine">search engine</a> <a title="Internet bot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot">bots</a> find pages on the site. In a nutshell, Site maps can improve <a title="Search engine optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">search engine optimization</a> of a site by making sure that all the pages can be found.</p>
<h4>story</h4>
<p>A content type that is defined in a default Drupal installation, typically used for content that has a date associated with it, such as a news item.</p>
<h3>T</h3>
<h4>tar</h4>
<p>Tape archive. A file format and the name of the program used to handle such files. Drupal projects are distributed in zip and tar formats.</p>
<h4>taxonomy</h4>
<p>The science of classification. In Drupal, Taxonomy is a powerful core module that gives your sites use of “terms”, organizational keywords known in other systems as categories, tags, or metadata. In Drupal, these terms are gathered within “vocabularies.” The Taxonomy module allows you to create, manage and apply those vocabularies.</p>
<h4>teaser</h4>
<p>A short introductory sentence or paragraph about a piece of content that informs readers about the subject of the content. By default, the first paragraph or two of the content is used (there is a setting for how much), usually with a link to the complete node.</p>
<h4>template</h4>
<p>A file that is mostly HTML with some special PHP code to substitute in values provided by an engine.</p>
<h4>term</h4>
<p>A term is the actual label that will be applied to the node.They are also known as tags.</p>
<h4>theme</h4>
<p>A file or collection of files (PHP, INFO, CSS, JPG, GIF, PNG), which together determine the look and feel of a site. A theme contains elements such as the header, icons, block layout, etc. Drupal modules define themeable functions which can be overridden by the theme file. There are additional themes available in the themes section of downloads.</p>
<h4>trigger</h4>
<p>Defined by modules, triggers typically result from some characteristic change in an entity maintained by a module. Some examples of triggers are: deleting content, adding a comment, a user has logged in, or adding a term. In addition to the triggers provided by Drupal core modules, triggers may be added by installed contributed modules.</p>
<h4>Tokens</h4>
<p>Tokens are small bits of text that can be placed into larger documents via simple placeholders, like %site-name or [user].</p>
<p>The tokens available depends on what modules you have enabled on your Drupal site. To view a list of the currently available tokens on your site, you can navigate to the Help &gt; Token page.</p>
<h3>U</h3>
<h4>UID</h4>
<p>User ID. The unique identifier for each user. It can be found in the path to the user profile, e.g. “http://drupal.org/user/1”</p>
<h4>unpublished</h4>

<h4>URL</h4>
<p>uniform resource locator. The address that defines the route to locate an object on an Internet server. Generally, the syntax for a URL contains the scheme, host-name, port, path and filename, e.g. http://www.drupal.org/node/937</p>
<h4>UX</h4>
<p>User experience. An umbrella term referring to the overall experience and satisfaction a user has when using a website. It is important to note that this “includes only what the user perceives and not all that is presented.”</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<h4>Views</h4>
<p>A contributed module which allows site developers a simple graphical interface for modifying the presentation of content. Views permits selection of specific fields to display, filtration against various node attributes, choice of basic layout options (i.e. list, full nodes, teasers, etc.), and other more advanced features. Many Drupal sites use Views extensively.</p>
<h4>vocabulary</h4>
<p>A vocabulary is a collection of terms.</p>
<h3>W</h3>
<h4>weight</h4>
<p>A term used by Drupal to define the priority or order in which a function is processed or a block / node is displayed. From Drupal 6, the weight field is adjusted dynamically using a drag-and-drop interface. Note: A lower weight value (-10) will float to the top of lists, while heavier (+10) weights will appear lower in lists.</p>
<h4>WYSIWYG</h4>
<p>What You See Is What You Get. An acronym used in computing to describe a method in which content is edited and formatted by interacting with an interface that closely resembles the final product.</p>
<h3>Z</h3>
<h4>Zip</h4>
<p>The zip file format is a data compression and archive format. A zip file contains one or more files that have been compressed, to reduce file size. Drupal core and modules are offered both in the zip and tar format.</p>
