<h2>How to create and add testimonials to your flexible page</h2>
<p>The Testimonials block allows you to share testimonials with your site visitors. They are filtered by a few different views and displayed on the flexible page block in a teaser-style block. You may display testimonials of students, faculty, community members, or a random selection of all testimonials.</p>

<li>Here is a breakdown of the fields associated with this content type:</li>
	<ul>
  		<li><strong>Title</strong> Every piece of content in Drupal has a title, and so does every page. In this one instance it is ok to leave this area blank.</li>
      <li><strong>Testimonial Image</strong> When displayed by the view this image will be resized to 140x160 pixels. The original content will show the image at original size so be careful not to upload an image too small or too large.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution</strong> Here you should enter the name of person who made the quote. </li>
      <li><strong>Affiliation</strong> This field allows for the person's relationship to the school. For example: Hartnell College Alumni, current student, etc.  </li>
  		<li><strong>Testimonial Type</strong> You may select students, staff, or community.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Area</strong> The program this person is affiliated with, this allows for this testimonial to appear on pages with related content. For example: culinary student testimonials will appear on culinary program related pages.</li>
  		<li><strong>Body</strong> This area is for the actual testimonial due to limited space this area allows for up to 200 characters (including spaces). </li>
  </ul>
 </ol>
<h3>How this works:</h3>
<p> This display can be filtered placing following <strong>view pane:</strong></p>
<ul>

	<li><strong>View: Testimonials: Related Testimonials Shortlist</strong> Allows you to customize the list of testimonials by Academic areas, Testimonial Type and number of testimonials to show on this page; if no related testimonials are available this block will not show.</br>
	<img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/testimonial-pane2.jpg" </li>
</ul>
<p><br> You can place, drag and drop this view to anywhere in panelizer. If there are no related testimonials this area will be blank.</p>
