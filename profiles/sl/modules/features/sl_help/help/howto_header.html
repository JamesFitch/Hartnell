<h2>How to add a custom header image to your page</h2>
<p>You can upload an image to be placed in the header of your page into the 'Banner image' field on the 'Images' vertical tab.  Header images are automatically placed.</p>
<img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/howto-header-field.png" />

<p>This website strives to account for both mobile and desktop visitors.  For that reason header images are handled specially.  You'll want to be sure your image works well for everyone.

<p>For best results, your header image must be 200 pixels high. Because screen sizes vary, your header will show at one of the following widths:
<ul>
<li>240 pixels</li>
<li>520 pixels</li>
<li>700 pixels</li>
<li>880 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>The proper width will be selected according to the size of a site visitor's screen - the important thing is that the image should look OK at all those widths.</p>
