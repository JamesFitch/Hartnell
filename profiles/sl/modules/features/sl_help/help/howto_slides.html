<h2>How to place promotional slides on your internal pages</h2>
<p>There are two ways to post a slideshow or slides on your pages:
<ol>
<li> Create new content, Slide Collection, or</li>
<li> you can create a slideshow right on the page you're editing, by going to Images in the vertical tabs, and clicking on + Create Slide Collection.</li></ol>

<h3>Here's how it goes, either way</h3>
<ol><li>Add a title (this is mandatory)</li>
<li>Then, begin creating slides:<ul>
<li>Upload an image</li>
<li>Give it a title</li>
<li>Give it a description</li>
<li>Give it a URL</li>
<li>Click Add Another Item to repeat</li>
<li>Repeat until you have all the slides you want</li></ul></li>
<li>You can rearrange slides by dragging up and down on the cross-hair handles.</li>
<li>Click Save</li></ol>

<p>If you know the name of a slideshow, you can start typing its name in the Slideshow textbox in the Images vertical tab of the page you'd like to add it to.

<p><strong>Design Note:</strong> Slideshows are designed to fill the entire width of the page. They can fit in smaller size but you may loose content or copy in the process.</p>
