<h3>How to add content grouped as tabs, accordion, or in two columns</h3>
<p>There are two fields that allow you to place groups of content onto your page.  These groups can be rendered as tabs, in a two-column layout, or as a list of paragraphs with an 'accordion' or 'read more' effect.
<p>We'll focus on the PRIMARY grouped content field, but the steps will be the same for the SECONDARY field.
<p>Visit the 'Primary grouped content' vertical tab.  Each content section you add will have a header and a body.
<p>Add some content, filling out the header and body fields. Click 'Add another' to add more sections to your group.  You can drag the sections up and down to order them as you wish.
<p>Grouped content won't show by default - you'll have to place it in your page.  After saving, go to 'Panelizer | Content'.  Here's how you add the sections:
<ol>
<li>In the bottom region, click the gear, then click 'Add content'</li>
<li>From the 'CWI Panes' tab on the left, choose from one of the page section formatter options - Tabbed, Accordion or 2-col.  Be sure to pick the one corresponding to the content field you filled out - either Primary or Secondary.
</li>
<li>Click Finish</li>
<li>Click 'Save' at the bottom left.</li>
</ol>
