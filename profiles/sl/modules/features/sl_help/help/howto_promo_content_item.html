<h2>How to add a reusable promotional item to your flexible page</h2>
<p>You can easily include promotional items to your page.  The place for a promo is in the sidebar or at the bottom of your page, and it looks something like this:</br>
<img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/howto-promo-rendered.png" /></p>
<p>While editing your page, switch to the 'Promotional Fields' vertical tab and scroll to the top of the form.</br>

<img class="screenshot" src="&path&/screenshots/howto-promo-field.png" /></p>
<p>You'll see a field marked 'Promo Content Items'.  Typing in that field will search for promo in the available Promotion content types - click the name you want from the search results, and save your page.</p>
<p>In the full layout, your Promotion person will automatically show.  However, if you need to place them by hand onto the page, you can do so by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Panelizer | Content screen for your page, choose the bottom region and click the gear | add content.</li>
  <li>Choose 'Node' from the left side tabs, and click 'Field: Promo Content Items (field_promo_content)'. Select the following options:

 </li>
  <li>Click 'Finish'</li>
  <li>Click 'Save' at the bottom-left of the screen.</li>
  <li>Click the 'View Published' tab to see how it looks</li>
</ol>
