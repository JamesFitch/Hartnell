  </li>
  <li>Click on "<b>Event</b>"<br/>
    <img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_event.jpg" alt="Add content - event">
  </li>
  <li>In "<b>Event Name</b>" enter the name or title of the event.</li>
  <li><p>In the "<b>Banner Image</b>" field, browse to the image you would like to display at the top of the page and then click the "<b>Upload</b>" button.</p>
    <img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_banner.jpg" alt="Banner upload">
    <p>Note that your image will be resized and then cropped to 915x300 pixels regardless of its original dimensions. So you will want to upload an image that has those dimensions already or is larger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"<b>Event Date</b>" has several options. First, decide if you want the event to have an ending date. If not, uncheck "<b>Show End Date</b>." The "to:" option below will disappear.</p>
    <p><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_enddate.jpg" alt="Show End Date"></p>
    <p>To choose the day, click on the "<b>Date</b>" field.</p>
    <p><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_datefield.jpg" alt="Date field"></p>
    <p>A little calendar will pop up, allowing you to choose the correct day.</p>
    <p>To choose the time, click on the "<b>Time</b>" field.</p>
    <p><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_timefield.jpg" alt="Time field"></p>
    <p>You may have to click twice to activate it. You can use the keyboard arrows to choose the time, or you can select each element (hour, minute, am/pm) and type it in.</p>
<p>You can make an event repeating by clicking the "<b>Repeat</b> checkbox.</p>
<p><img src="&path&screenshots/repeat.png"></p>
<p>You can set up your event so it repeats daily, weekly, monthly, or annually; you can set up which day or days it repeats on, and how many times the event occurs (or an end date.) You can also exclude or include dates.</p>
  </li>


  <li>For "<b>Location Name</b>" choose the building where the event will be held, as well as any other relevant location information.</li>
  <li>In "<b>Address</b>" enter the street address of the event. This will both display as a human readable address as well as get turned into a Google Maps link.</li>
  <li>In "<b>Event Description</b>" input the description of the event. This is a rich text field so you can add various styles and insert images and videos. To see how to use rich text, visit this help page: <a href="&topic:sl_help/msc_content_richtext&">Using the rich text editor</a>.</li>
  <li>Under "<b>Audience</b>" choose the appropriate audience for this event.</li>
  <li>Under "<b>Event Type</b>" select the appropriate event type.</li>
  <li>Unless instructed otherwise, do not enter anything into "<b>Tags</b>."</li>
  <li>
    <p>"<b>Related Links</b>" allows you to create a pseudo menu of related pages, either internal to the website or external on other websites.</p>
    <p>Enter the link text into "<b>Title</b>" and the relative path or URL into the "<b>URL</b>" field.</p>
    <p>To add multiple links, click "<b>Add another item</b>."</p>
    <p><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_relatedlinks.jpg" alt="Related links"></p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: If you are linking to an internal page, it is best to use the node ID, which is the unique identifier of the piece of content. This prevents broken links if the human-readable path to the page changes. To find the node ID of a piece of content:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to the page you want to link to (it can be helpful to do this in a separate browser tab or window).</li>
      <li>Ensure you are logged in as a content editor.</li>
      <li>Click on the content's "<b>Edit</b>," "<b>Edit draft</b>" or "<b>New draft</b>" tab.</li>
      <li>In the URL, find where it says "node/[somenumber]" e.g. "node/139".<br /><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_urlnodeid.jpg" alt="Node ID in the URL"></li>
      <li>The number is the node ID. Copy that portion of the URL (e.g. "node/139") and put that into the URL field of the related link.<br />
        <img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_relatedurl.jpg" alt="Related links URL"></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>In "<b>Event Description</b>" input the description of the event. This is a rich text field so you can add various styles and insert images and videos. To see how to use rich text, visit this help page: <a href="&topic:sl_help/msc_content_richtext&">Using the rich text editor</a>.</li>
  <li>Unless otherwise instructed, do not use the "<b>Contact Person</b>" field.</li>
  <li>The "<b>Sign Up Form Link</b>" allows you to direct visitors toward a signup page, either a webform in this site or an external webpage. The field works similarly to Related Links except you can only enter one sign up link and it will display as a button at the top of the page.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are <i>updating</i> an event, before saving go to the "<b>Revision information</b>" fieldset.</p>
    <p><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_revisiontab.jpg" alt="Revisions fieldset"></p>
    <p>Ensure the "<b>Create new revision</b>" option is checked and then provide a brief explanation of your changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>When you have finished adding or updating the content, press "<b>Save</b>" at the bottom of the page.<br/>
      <img src="&path&screenshots/msc_content_addcontent_save.jpg" alt="Save button">
  </li>
  <li>Note that the "<b>Preview</b>" functionality is limited and will not completely display how your content will look once published.</li>
</ol>
