<h1>Workbench Access</h1>
<p>As per the official module page, "Workbench Access creates editorial access controls based on hierarchies. [...] When creating and editing content, users will be asked to place the content in an editorial section. Other users within that section or its parents will be able to edit the content. A user may be granted editorial rights to a section specific to his account or by his assigned role on the site."</p>
<h2>Setting up site section management</h2>
<p>To set up specific users to manage particular sections of the site using Workbench Access:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using the admin menu, go to "<b>Configuration</b>" then scroll to the bottom to find "<b>Workbench Access</b>."</li>
  <li>Find the section over which the user should have content editing privileges. Note that if a section has subsections, the user will have editing privileges in all subsections.</li>
  <li>Click on the <b>editors</b> link corresponding to the section to which you want to grant administrative access.<br /><img src="&path&screenshots/msc_users_wa_sectioneditor.jpg" alt="Section editor"></li>
